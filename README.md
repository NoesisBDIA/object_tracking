# Computer Vision Project

### Ideas of problems to solve:

- Plants recognition: train a classifier on a plant dataset, predict the plant from a photo taken
- Cheaters (video games) detection: compare movements between legits players and cheaters

### Steps:

- Learn how to use Computer Vision libraries (OpenCV, etc.)
- Choose a topic (problem to solve)
- Find a relevant dataset
- Develop a solution
